# callaway-brandon-a5-angrybirdsclone

This was originally meant to be an angry birds clone (which was originally a suika clone (which was originally a contra clone))
I have had nothing but issues with Godot running on my laptop and I'm very sorry for the shotty work for this project.

Preamble:
It appears that the 2D shape plugin needs to be reinstalled and reenabled, following the Godot project being restarted in order to see visuals.
You must click and hold left mouse button PRIOR to attempting to pull the slingshot back (As the on_body_entered signal is only called the frame it occurs, and not constantly)

Instructions:
Click and hold Left Mouse button, then, while holding, pull the slingshot band with the ball to the left of the screen to launch it into obstacles.
